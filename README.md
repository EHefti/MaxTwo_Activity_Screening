# MaxTwo Activity Screening
A short code to pre-assess the electrophysiological activity in MaxTwo recordings before sorting the data. Assessment based on spike amplitudes.

In order to save time, this code gives you a short overview of the activity in your recordings. If there is none - you may skip the sorting.

To run the Screening over multiple weeks, your data has to be nicely arranged in a consistent folder structure. The structure can then be used for pattern matching in the code.


The code uses some functions from MaxWell in the "+mxw" folder and some selfmade functons in the "functions" folder.
