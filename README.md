# MaxTwo Activity Screening
A short code to pre-assess the electrophysiological activity in MaxTwo recordings before sorting the data. Assessment based on spike amplitudes.

In order to save time, this code gives you a short overview of the activity in your recordings. If there is none - you may skip the sorting.

To run the Screening over multiple weeks, your data has to be nicely arranged in a consistent folder structure.
